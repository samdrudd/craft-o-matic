# [Silky Sam's Craft-o-Matic!](https://samdrudd.github.io/craft-o-matic)

Silky Sam's Craft-o-Matic is a tool for FFXIV crafters to use to quickly and easily keep track of their progress towards their crafts. Search for and select any number of items you want to craft, and Craft-o-Matic will immediately show you a list of all raw materials you need to craft each item. You can also keep track of how many of those materials you have, so you can see at-a-glance if you're ready to start crafting or if you have more materials to collect.
